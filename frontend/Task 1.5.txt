What changed, and why?
We can see different values of performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO. The performance in SSR for example looks different than CSR. 
SSR is better than CSR, because Instead of waiting for JavaScript to download and run, the server directly renders an HTML document upon receiving a request from the browser.
There is also a PWA impact, which added overhead in SSR (e.g., mobile SSR with PWA: TBT(Total Blocking Time) 480ms vs. 170ms without PWA) due to service worker registration/caching logic, but less severe than in CSR.  

Did the new features improve or worsen performance, accessibility, best practices, or SEO?
- Performance:
  - SSR improved performance(especially mobile), reducing TBT and First Contentful Paint (FCP).  
  - PWA slightly worsened performance in SSR (due to service worker setup) but less than in CSR.  

- Accessibility/SEO/Best Practices:  
  - No changes: All versions scored Accessibility 100, SEO 83, and similar Best Practices (78â€“79).  

Did recommendations appear or disappear? 
The recommendations appear and disappear at the same time, for example PWA-related issues appear in PWA versions:  
- Avoid requesting notification permission on page load.
- Avoid requesting geolocation permission without user context.
- Properly size images" (e.g., mobile SSR with PWA: 93KiB savings).
The recommendations that disappears are for example in SSR versions:
- "Minimize main-thread work" disappears due to reduced client-side JS.
- "Eliminate render-blocking resources" is no longer flagged (rendering happens server-side).
